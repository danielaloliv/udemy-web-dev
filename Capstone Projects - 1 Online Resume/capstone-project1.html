            <h3>Product designer</h3>
            <h4>Pixie</h4>
            <h5>Aug. 2023 - Dec. 2023 (laid off)</h5>
            <p>Pixie is a SaaS for accountants and bookkeepers to manage their practice by keeping track of tasks and measure employee performance. I analysed the platform with a designer colleague, customer success and sales teams to suggest multiple UX improvements & ran brainstorm sessions and workshops with all teams to ensure vision alignment regarding the future of the product for certain features, how user research from quantitative and qualitative sources were to be together to create a single source of truth and the brand/product purpose and mission. Besides that, worked together with developers to define how features could work and wrote specs for future developments. Also started a path to a visual refresh of the platform so it could be more aligned with the brand.</p>

            <h3>Product designer</h3>
            <h4>PÚBLICO</h4>
            <h5>Jan. - Aug. 2023</h5>
            <p>I listen to everything everybody has to say and try to get to know a little more everyday about our product, publico.pt. 

                User centric thinking “evangelization” through user research iniciatives, design thinking practices and collaboration throughout all departments in the newsroom. One of my main jobs is to make people understand they all have part in the one experience our readers have when interacting with anything that’s related to our brand, and that’s why collaboration between departments is so important. Also, a big part of my job at PÚBLICO is to educate teams and the structure with what Design can bring to the table in terms of product strategy and development in a sustainable and scalable way. 
                
                Main responsibilities:
                — Understand the scope of projects with stakeholders, data, technical, editorial, (…) teams (I like to call it the “digging” process);
                — Run discovery phases through benchmark, user interviews (recruit, scheduling, running, analyzing), data analysis, technical flows, among other activities;
                — Manage design developments for the subscription teams' features and campaigns on digital channels;
                — Document bugs, inconsistencies and improvements with editorial and development teams;
                — Design user flows, prototypes, user interfaces and go with handoff with the development team and external providers;
                — Set up and follow up on UX metrics defined for each project to understand what worked and what didn't;
                — Organize cross-department sessions for ideations, knowledge sharing and in-house iniciatives that are happening, trying to make everybody feel like they know what’s happening in the newsroom;
                — Give mentorship to a junior graphic designer transitioning to digital: pass skateholder management skills, UX metrics, user research stack, front-end concepts, product design best practices and seeing her become independent in ~9mo.</p>
